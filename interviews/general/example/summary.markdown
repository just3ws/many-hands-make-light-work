The idea behind summary.markdown is answer the 5 W's of the interview in descending order of importance: Who, Why, What, Where, When.

Who was interviewed. Why did we interview the person? What was actually discussed in teh interview. Less important but could still be relevant.  Where and When was the interview.

Relevant links can be added using the Markdown link syntax that looks like [text to show](http://www.example.com).

> Block quotes can be used when quoting a significant statement from the interview.


If you want to make a list, here's a good example:

*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
